      not_created: |-
        The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
        create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
        default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
        then the machine is not created for that environment.

        The VM is paused. To resume the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        or `vagrant resume`

      running: |-
        The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
        shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
        suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
        simply run `vagrant up`.
